# fastmvp

FastMVP is a base for creating an app quickly: you write a simple prompt, the flow refines it, and from there it generates a complete app with backend and frontend in 7 simple steps.

## What it does
- Starts from a short idea (prompt) and turns it into a clear specification.
- Defines API contracts with OpenAPI as the source of truth.
- Implements backend and frontend following clean architecture and Feature-Sliced.

## 7-step flow (summary)
1) Specify: turns the idea into a spec.
2) Contracts: updates OpenAPI.
3) Tasks (API): breaks down backend tasks.
4) Implement (API): implements the API.
5) Figma prompts (optional): prepares UI prompts.
6) Tasks (Web): breaks down frontend tasks.
7) Implement (Web): implements the frontend.
